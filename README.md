The layout of this curriculum page is similarly divided into distinct sections to present clear, accessible information. The sections are stacked hierarchically so that the reader flows from personal information to professional qualification. In the very first div "photo-and-name", we have a photo that depicts a profile picture along with contact information, which presents an immediate visual identity and makes it easy to access contact details.

Next is the "objective" section which welcomes the visitor with a career goal in videogame programming, aligning professional focus quickly. Next, comes the education part of the CV — we put it in a table to make it cleaner. It provides the viewer a quick overview of the candidate's educational record, up to and including relevant certifications — from elementary school through recent college.

Similar to the "experience" section, it is also in table format and emphasizes relevant skills with actual work and programming experience. Finally we have the "bio-data" section that provides specific and useful personal details—languages, nationality, marital status—which helps give broader meaning to situate the viewer in context regarding strength and experience.

The different sections are structured in a way that ensures continuity of scope and is easily accessible such that the person hiring will be able to skim through your profile and credentials without any hassle.

The *visual design* choices made for the project prioritize simplicity, clarity, and a clean user experience. The design employs a minimalistic style with a focus on *readability and accessibility*. Key decisions include:

1. *Typography*:
   - The font family used is 'Montserrat', sans-serif, chosen for its modern, clean look that enhances readability across devices. It is a versatile typeface that pairs well with the overall aesthetic.

2. *Color Palette*:
   - The primary color scheme includes shades of *whitesmoke, **light blue (#27aae1), and **gray*. Whitesmoke provides a neutral, soft background that reduces eye strain, while the light blue accents add a touch of vibrancy, guiding user attention to key elements like headings and contact details.

3. *Layout*:
   - The main content is wrapped in a centered container (#page) with a *width of 60%* to ensure a balanced view on various screen sizes. A minimum width of *600px* prevents the design from becoming too compressed on smaller screens, maintaining a consistent and professional look.
   - Floating elements like the profile photo (.photo) and contact information (.contact-info-box) create a visually appealing structure, while the use of padding and margins maintains adequate spacing.

4. *Section Design*:
   - Headings are styled with borders and uppercase text for clear separation of content sections, using subtle borders and padding for emphasis.
   - Tables are used for structured content such as education, work experience, and bio-data, providing a clear, organized layout.

This design approach ensures a *user-friendly* experience with an emphasis on *clarity and professionalism*, ideal for a modern resume or profile page.
